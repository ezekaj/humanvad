# Feature #2: Prosodic Rhythm Tracking - Test Results

**Date:** 2025-10-05
**Status:** ‚ùå **NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PRODUCTION**
**Recommendation:** Skip Feature #2, move to Feature #3

---

## Summary

Feature #2 (Prosodic Rhythm Tracking) was implemented and tested with realistic speech-like patterns. **Results show the feature has significant issues and should NOT be integrated.**

---

## Test Results

### Test 1: Rhythmic Speech Detection
**Goal:** Detect stable rhythm in continuous speech
**Expected:** High rhythm_strength (>0.5), Low turn-end (<0.5)
**Actual:**
- Average Rhythm Strength: **0.55** ‚úì (barely passes)
- Average Turn-End Contribution: **0.51** ‚úó (too high - should be <0.5)

**Result:** ‚ùå **FAIL** - Turn-end contribution too high for stable rhythm

---

### Test 2: Rhythm Disruption Detection
**Goal:** Detect when rhythm breaks (turn boundary signal)
**Expected:** rhythm_strength DROPS, turn-end INCREASES
**Actual:**
- Final Rhythm Strength: **0.23** ‚úì (low, as expected)
- Final Turn-End Contribution: **0.77** ‚úì (high, as expected)

**Result:** ‚úÖ **PASS** - Correctly detected rhythm disruption

---

### Test 3: Tempo Deceleration Detection
**Goal:** Detect when speaker slows down (end-of-turn signal)
**Expected:** Negative tempo_change, Increased turn-end
**Actual:**
- Final Tempo Change: **+0.00** ‚úó (should be negative)
- Final Turn-End Contribution: **0.57** (moderate)

**Result:** ‚ùå **FAIL** - Tempo tracking not working correctly

---

### Test 4: Adaptation Speed
**Goal:** Respond to rhythm changes within 100-200ms
**Expected:** Rhythm drop >0.2 within 10 frames (100ms)
**Actual:**
- Rhythm before disruption: **0.50**
- Rhythm after disruption: **0.50**
- Rhythm drop: **0.00** ‚úó (no adaptation detected)

**Result:** ‚ùå **FAIL** - Rhythm tracker does NOT adapt to changes

---

## Problems Identified

### 1. **Autocorrelation Window Too Long (500ms)**
- Window: 50 frames @ 10ms = 500ms
- Real speech changes faster than this
- Tracker "remembers" old rhythm patterns too long
- Cannot detect turn boundaries in real-time

### 2. **Tempo Tracking Broken**
- Tempo deceleration not detected (Test 3 FAIL)
- Tempo change calculation inconsistent
- May need different tempo estimation method

### 3. **No Real-Time Adaptation**
- Tracker does NOT respond to rhythm changes within 100ms (Test 4 FAIL)
- Would miss turn boundaries in real conversation
- Too slow for production use

### 4. **Turn-End Contribution Too High for Stable Speech**
- Even during stable rhythm, turn-end contribution = 0.51 (Test 1 FAIL)
- Should be <0.4 during continuous speech
- Would cause false interruptions in production

---

## Why Feature #2 Should Be Skipped

### 1. **Fundamental Design Issue**
The autocorrelation-based approach assumes:
- Speech rhythm is periodic (often NOT true in natural conversation)
- 500ms window is sufficient (too slow for real-time)
- Energy patterns reflect rhythm (weak signal in real speech)

### 2. **Limited Accuracy Benefit**
- Only 1 out of 4 tests passed
- Would likely ADD noise to turn-end detection
- May DECREASE accuracy vs baseline (needs real benchmark to confirm)

### 3. **Engineering Cost vs Benefit**
- Requires significant tuning (window sizes, thresholds)
- Needs real conversational audio to tune properly
- Low probability of >5% accuracy improvement
- Better to invest time in Features #3-10

### 4. **Real-World Audio Access Issue**
- Mozilla Common Voice is gated (requires authentication)
- No easy access to German conversational audio
- Cannot validate with real data before production

## Alternative Approaches (If Revisiting Rhythm Later)

If rhythm tracking is attempted again, consider:

1. **Shorter window (100-200ms)** - Faster adaptation
2. **Spectral flux** instead of energy autocorrelation
3. **Syllable rate detection** (4-6 Hz for German)
4. **Deep learning-based rhythm features** (pre-trained on German speech)

---

## Recommendation

**SKIP Feature #2 (Prosodic Rhythm Tracking)**

Move directly to:
- **Feature #3:** Temporal Context Encoding (Rotational Dynamics)
- **Feature #4:** N400-style Semantic Prediction Error
- **Feature #5:** Disfluency vs Completion Detection

These features have stronger research backing and clearer implementation paths.

- `rhythm_tracker.py` (230 lines) - Rhythm tracker implementation
- `test_rhythm_realistic.py` (200+ lines) - Validation tests
- `FEATURE_2_TEST_RESULTS.md` (this file) - Test documentation

**Status:** Implementation complete, but NOT production-ready.

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Document Feature #2 results (this file)
2. ‚è≠Ô∏è Skip to Feature #3: Temporal Context Encoding
3. üìã Continue systematic 10-feature improvement plan
4. üéØ Aim for 90-95% accuracy (currently 40% baseline)
